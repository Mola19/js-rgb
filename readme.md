# **WARNING**

this project directly interacts with your hardware and might break it. Although it is unlikely and i try to test it as good as possible, but you never know. I take no responsibility for any damage caused.

# about

This project aims to be a complete replacement for all your vendor software, like armoury crate and icue.
Planned features are.

- Setting DPI, angle snapping etc. (partially already implemented)
- Setting RGB lighting
- Setting button mapping
- Every device type and it's features (keyboards, mousepads, gpus, motherboards...)
- hotplug support
- and everything else that i have forgotten 

## But isn't this just like OpenRGB?

No, OpenRGB is a standalone Software that can only change RGB lighting. The plan for this project is to make this a library so it can be used much more easily in other softwares. An actual frontend is in the works.

Also i think that OpenRGB being written in c++ makes it less accessible, since it isn't as popular as Javascript or Python. Because community contributions are so important for such a project i think it makes sense to sacrifice a bit of performance, but i still try to make it as performant as possible

## Why this name?

No clue, had no better idea, please tell me if you have a better one.

# wiki

I plan on making a wiki documenting every device precisely, so anyone can "easily" make a new port in another language.
